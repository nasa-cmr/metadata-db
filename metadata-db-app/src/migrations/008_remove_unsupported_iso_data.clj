  ISO types we do not support from Catalog REST. This database migration removes that data from the
  Metadata DB. The formats removed are ISO - the prototype iso format and ISO-GRACE which has two
  strings because Catalog REST changed it at one point. We could never index this data so unindexing
  it is unnecessary."
