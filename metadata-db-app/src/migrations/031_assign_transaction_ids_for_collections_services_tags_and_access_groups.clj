;; This migration assigns transaction-ids to all existing concepts except granules (they will be
;; handled by a separate job). In order to avoid collisions with new transaction-ids generated
;; for concepts ingested while this migration is running, and to avoid the need to use locking,
;; this migration creates a separate sequence from the global transaction-id sequence used by the
;; metadata-db code when saving concepts. The migration sequence created here begins half way below
;; the start of the global transaction-id seqeunece. At the time of this writing that would
;; be 1,000,000,000. Since the global transaction-id sequence used by metadata-db starts
;; at 2,000,000,000 and there are less than 400,000,000 concepts at this time, the
;; the transaction-ids assigned to existing concepts by this migration should stay well
;; below those assigned to newer conepts ingested while it is running. This would not be
;; the case if this migration were to be run at a later date with more than 999,999,999 existing
;; concepts.
